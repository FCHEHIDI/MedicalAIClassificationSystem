# Contributing to Medical Classification Engine

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our professional medical AI system! This project demonstrates production-ready machine learning with healthcare compliance and safety-first principles.

## üè• Medical AI Principles

This project follows strict medical AI safety standards:
- **Conservative confidence levels** (prefer uncertainty over false confidence)
- **Healthcare compliance** (HIPAA-conscious design)
- **Clinical workflow integration** (AI assists, humans decide)
- **Professional validation** (comprehensive testing and monitoring)

## üîß Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Docker Desktop
- Git

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Medical-Classification-Engine.git
cd Medical-Classification-Engine

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start development environment
docker-compose up -d
```

## üß™ Testing Standards

### Required Tests
All contributions must include:
- ‚úÖ **Unit tests** for new functionality
- ‚úÖ **Medical AI validation** tests
- ‚úÖ **Healthcare compliance** checks
- ‚úÖ **Integration tests** for API changes

### Running Tests
```bash
# Unit tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Medical AI validation
python scripts/validate_model_robustness.py

# Code quality
black src/ tests/
isort src/ tests/
flake8 src/ tests/
```

## üìã Code Standards

### Medical AI Code Guidelines
- **Safety First**: All medical AI code must prioritize patient safety
- **Conservative Approach**: Prefer lower confidence over false positives
- **Professional Documentation**: Include medical context in docstrings
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive medical-specific error handling

### Code Quality
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guide
- Use type hints consistently
- Write comprehensive docstrings
- Include professional logging
- Implement proper error handling

### Example Medical AI Function
```python
def classify_medical_text(text: str, confidence_threshold: float = 0.6) -> MedicalClassificationResult:
    """
    Classify medical text with healthcare-appropriate confidence levels.
    
    Args:
        text: Medical text to classify (clinical notes, reports, etc.)
        confidence_threshold: Minimum confidence for recommendation (default: 0.6)
        
    Returns:
        MedicalClassificationResult with specialty, confidence, and clinical recommendations
        
    Safety:
        - Conservative confidence calibration for medical safety
        - Recommends human review for uncertain cases
        - Follows "better uncertain than wrong" principle
    """
    # Implementation with safety checks
    pass
```
