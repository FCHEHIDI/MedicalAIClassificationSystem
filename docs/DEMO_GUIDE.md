## 🏥 **Medical AI Safety Principles**

### **Conservative Confidence Philosophy**
```
High Confidence (60%+): Route to specialist
Moderate Confidence (35-59%): Specialist + senior review  
Low Confidence (<35%): Manual review recommended
```

### **Why This Matters**
- **Medical AI Safety**: Better uncertain and safe than confident and wrong
- **Professional Standards**: Conservative confidence = responsible AI
- **Clinical Integration**: AI assists, humans decide
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Follows healthcare AI best practices

---

## 🎯 **Expected Demo Duration**

- **Setup Time**: 2-3 minutes (docker-compose up)
- **Demo Execution**: 3-5 minutes (automated demonstration)
- **Interactive Exploration**: 10-15 minutes (optional)
- **Total Time**: ~20 minutes for complete technical review

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**
1. **Port Conflicts**: Ensure ports 8000, 8501, 5000, 3000 are available
2. **Docker Not Running**: Start Docker Desktop before running demo
3. **Services Starting**: Wait 30-60 seconds for all services to initialize

### **Verification Commands**
```bash
# Check running services
docker ps

# Check service logs
docker-compose logs api
docker-compose logs dashboard

# Test API health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```
